Brent Oil Price Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes how major political and economic events impact Brent crude oil prices. The study focuses on understanding the fluctuations in oil prices due to geopolitical decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, international sanctions, and OPEC policy changes.
The insights generated from this analysis can help investors, policymakers, and energy companies make informed decisions, manage risks, and predict market trends effectively.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The project is divided into three main tasks:
1.	Data Analysis Workflow & Understanding the Model
o	Define the steps for analyzing Brent oil prices.
o	Understand time series models (ARIMA, GARCH) and Bayesian inference.
o	Identify assumptions, limitations, and communication channels for insights.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis & Time Series Forecasting
o	Perform data preprocessing, visualization, and trend analysis.
o	Implement statistical and machine learning models: 
ï‚§	ARIMA & GARCH for time series forecasting.
ï‚§	Bayesian inference (PyMC3) for uncertainty estimation.
ï‚§	LSTM (Neural Networks) for deep learning-based predictions.
o	Explore the impact of economic indicators and technological factors on oil prices.
3.	Interactive Dashboard Development
o	Build a Flask API (backend) to serve data and model predictions.
o	Develop a React-based frontend to visualize key trends and correlations.
o	Implement interactive features like filters, event markers, and time range selection.
